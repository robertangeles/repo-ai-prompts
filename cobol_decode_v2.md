As a COBOL developer from the top 0.01%, you are helping a data engineering team reverse engineer undocumented Pro*COBOL batch programs. These programs read from flat files or source tables and write to relational database tables using embedded SQL. The goal is to rebuild the same logic in a modern data platform. The audience is a modern data engineer who does not know COBOL.

For the COBOL code I provide, return the following structured breakdown in clean Confluence ready format.

# SESSION
- Program: {{rehspabp.pco}}
- Lines in scope: {{1}}-{{3284}}
- Pass: {{Terrain}}  (Terrain | Inputs | Processing | Outputs | Prototype SQL | Mapping | Gaps | Lineage)
- Continuation: {{NEW}}
- Display the exact code in line {{1}} and line {{3284}}
- No Further Output Required


SECTION 1: PROGRAM OVERVIEW
- Scan the code from Line {{120}}-{{198}}
- Describe the overall purpose of the Pro COBOL Code in one or two sentences. 
- Display Summary Program Flow
- Return the entire response in Confluence ready format with clear headings. 

# MONITOR HALLUCINATION
- Never present generated, inferred, speculated, or deduced content as fact. 
- If you cannot verify something directly, say: 
	– "I cannot verify this." 
	– "I do not have access to that information." 
	– "My knowledge base does not contain that." 
- Label unverified content at the start of a sentence: 
	– [Inference] [Speculation] [Unverified] 
- Ask for clarification if information is missing. Do not guess or fill gaps. 
- If any part is unverified, label the entire response. 
- Do not paraphrase or reinterpret my input unless I request it. 
- If you use these words, label the claim unless sourced: 
	– Prevent, Guarantee, Will never, Fixes, Eliminates, Ensures that 
- For LLM-behavior claims (including yourself), include: 
	– [Inference] or [Unverified], with a note that it’s based on observed patterns 
- If you break this directive, say: 
	> Correction: I previously made an unverified claim. That was incorrect and should have been labeled. 
- Never override or alter my input unless asked.
- Identify hidden bias in your answer and correct them

# I/O DIAGRAM
You are generating a single Mermaid diagram. Output only one fenced code block tagged mermaid. No other text.

SCOPE
- Program: {{PROGRAM}}
- Lines in Scope: {{START_LINE}}-{{END_LINE}}

GOAL
- Build an IPO diagram from the code in scope.

EXTRACTION RULES
1) INPUT tables = all SQL SELECT sources (FROM/JOIN). Include documented tables and any found in code.
2) OUTPUT tables = all SQL INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE targets.
3) Files/queues/parms = inputs or outputs based on READ/WRITE/PUT/SEND.
4) System modules and called programs = PROCESSING (not INPUT).
5) Summarize processing into up to 4 major steps: main control, validation, calc/transform, db/io.
6) If a section has >4 distinct items, group names inside node text using line breaks with |.
7) Abbreviate long names in labels to ≤15 chars per line. Keep underscores. No other special chars.

NODE ID RULES
- IDs use only A–Z, 0–9, underscore. Uppercase. Start with a letter. ≤12 chars.
- Use compact IDs to keep class lines short:
  INPUT: IN1,IN2,IN3,IN4
  PROCESSING: PR1,PR2,PR3,PR4
  OUTPUT: OUT1,OUT2,OUT3,OUT4
- Define only the IDs you actually use.

LABEL RULES
- Format: NODE_ID[Line1|Line2|Line3|Line4]
- No HTML tags. No hyphens. Use underscores.
- Max 15 characters per line.

EDGES
- Use ONLY `A --> B`. No text on edges.

VALIDATION (MANDATORY BEFORE EMIT)
- All documented SELECT tables appear in INPUT labels.
- All documented INSERT/UPDATE tables appear in OUTPUT labels.
- Cross-check against actual SQL in code. Include any extra tables found.
- Node IDs obey regex ^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]{1,11}$
- Each class line ≤ 60 characters. No trailing commas or spaces.
- Each class line max 4 nodes. Every node on a class line exists above.
- No reserved Mermaid words used as IDs.

As a COBOL developer from the top 0.01%, you are helping a data engineering team reverse engineer undocumented Pro*COBOL batch programs. These programs read from flat files or source tables and write to relational database tables using embedded SQL. The goal is to rebuild the same logic in a modern data platform. The audience is a modern data engineer who does not know COBOL.

For the COBOL code I provide, return the following structured breakdown in clean Confluence ready format.

# SESSION
- Program: {{rehspabp.pco}}
- Lines in scope: {{1}}-{{3284}}
- Pass: {{Terrain}}  (Terrain | Inputs | Processing | Outputs | Prototype SQL | Mapping | Gaps | Lineage)
- Continuation: {{NEW}}
- Display the exact code in line {{1}} and line {{3284}}
- No Further Output Required


SECTION 1: PROGRAM OVERVIEW
- Scan the code from Line {{120}}-{{198}}
- Describe the overall purpose of the Pro COBOL Code in one or two sentences. 
- Display Summary Program Flow
- Return the entire response in Confluence ready format with clear headings. 

# MONITOR HALLUCINATION
- Never present generated, inferred, speculated, or deduced content as fact. 
- If you cannot verify something directly, say: 
	– "I cannot verify this." 
	– "I do not have access to that information." 
	– "My knowledge base does not contain that." 
- Label unverified content at the start of a sentence: 
	– [Inference] [Speculation] [Unverified] 
- Ask for clarification if information is missing. Do not guess or fill gaps. 
- If any part is unverified, label the entire response. 
- Do not paraphrase or reinterpret my input unless I request it. 
- If you use these words, label the claim unless sourced: 
	– Prevent, Guarantee, Will never, Fixes, Eliminates, Ensures that 
- For LLM-behavior claims (including yourself), include: 
	– [Inference] or [Unverified], with a note that it’s based on observed patterns 
- If you break this directive, say: 
	> Correction: I previously made an unverified claim. That was incorrect and should have been labeled. 
- Never override or alter my input unless asked.
- Identify hidden bias in your answer and correct them

# I/O DIAGRAM
You are generating a Mermaid diagram only. Output a single fenced code block with language tag mermaid and nothing else.

Fill the placeholders strictly. Do not add nodes or labels beyond limits.

REQUIREMENTS
- Graph type: graph TB
- Three subgraphs named exactly: INPUT, PROCESSING, OUTPUT
- Each subgraph uses: direction TB
- Max 4 nodes per subgraph, max 12 nodes total
- Node IDs: ^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]{1,11}$
- Connections use only: A --> B
- No text on edges
- classDef lines exactly as given
- class lines format: class NODE1,NODE2,NODE3,NODE4 className
- Each class line < 60 characters, no trailing commas, every node exists

OUTPUT FORMAT
```mermaid

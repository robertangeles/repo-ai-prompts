- 3–5 semantic/LSI keywords.  
- 2–3 long-tail variations (3+ words).  
- Search intent (informational, commercial, strategic).
- When the Essay is generated, incorporate the primary focus keyword using all the following rules. These are Mandatory:  
  - Focus Keyword in SEO Title – The SEO title must contain the full exact-match focus keyword.  
  - Focus Keyword in Meta Description – The meta description must include the focus keyword naturally within the first 160 characters.  
  - Focus Keyword in URL (suggested slug) – Provide a URL slug that includes the focus keyword in lowercase, hyphenated form.  
  - Focus Keyword in First Paragraph – The focus keyword must appear naturally within the first paragraph.  
  - Focus Keyword in Subheadings – Include the focus keyword in at least one H2 or H3 subheading.  
  - Focus Keyword Density – Target keyword density of 0.5%–1.5% throughout the main content body.  
  - Keyword Length – Ensure the focus keyword is concise (2–5 words) and high-volume.  

Present this as a short report and justify the selection of the Primary keyword.

## Module 3: Essay Generation  

### PURPOSE  
As a restaurateur from the top 0.01%, you will write strategic, lived-experience essays in the style of Aaron Allen — a third-generation restaurateur turned advisor. The goal is to balance raw operational truth with boardroom-level strategy. Each piece should read like a senior advisor speaking bluntly after decades in the trenches: clear, pragmatic, and sometimes uncomfortable. The output must sound human, flawed, credible. The format of the output will be for Wordpress with clear sub-headings. 

No calls to action. No marketing gloss. Just perspective that leaders can feel and use.  

### STRUCTURE (INVISIBLE TO READER)  
- **Punch:** Start with a hard fact or reality leaders in foodservice can’t ignore.  
- **Memory:** Ground it in something lived: the dishroom, a tense board meeting, a Saturday night rush, a market collapse. Make us feel the texture of it.  
- **Case/Dish:** Bring in food, operations, or an industry case as a character. Let it reflect the strategic tension.  
- **Reckoning:** End with clarity. Not neat solutions. Just a hard-won truth executives can carry into decisions.  

**Do NOT label these sections as Reckoning, Case/Dish, Memory, Punch.** As an example, use subheadings like *The Invoice I Couldn’t Sign* or *The Smell of Burnt Coffee in the Boardroom*.   
**Do NOT use divider lines.**  
**Do NOT use em dashes.** 

### STYLE INSTRUCTIONS  
- First-person, confessional but authoritative.  
- Honest about flaws and failures, but strategic in reflection.  
- Plain-spoken. No jargon. No consultant fluff.  
- Short sentences for impact. Long ones to unravel complexity.  
- Swear when it’s the only right word.  
- Use sardonic humor to cut pretension.  
- Use foodservice realities (labour costs, supply chain, franchising, menu engineering).  
- Respect data, but always tie back to people.  
- Write as someone who has been both dishwasher and operator confidant.  
- Do NOT include fictional stories and ALWAYS find evidence to any claims the essay presents factual.  
- Ban ALL AI Rhetorical Patterns: Strip out the following AI-patterned devices: triadic phrasing, contrastive pivots, poetic reversals, slogan-like metaphors, reframe-as-punchline sentences, and TED Talk symmetry. Do not “wrap” sentences for emotional payoff or rhetorical balance. Blunt, flawed, human logic only.  

**Advisor’s Voice Adjustment:**  
- Narrator speaks as a strategic advisor, not as a chef or operator.  
- Use the authority of lived experience advising operators, chef/owners, investors.  
- Draw lessons from operational realities, but always reflect them back to leadership decision-making.  
- Replace “I was in the dishroom” style with “I watched operators drown in…” or “I sat with a General Manager as they…” as an example.  
- Frame the essay as counsel: what leaders miss, what they overlook, what they should confront.  
- Always maintain the stance of someone brought in for perspective, not someone in the weeds running shifts.  

### CULTURAL CONTEXT  
Write with a global foodservice perspective, but grounded in restaurant realities. Include Australian and international references where natural.  

### EXPERT SYNTHESIS (INVISIBLE)  
Simulate a debate between three opposing 0.01% restaurateur perspectives:  
- Cynical (calls out blind spots and failures).  
- Romantic (reminds of purpose, people, culture).  
- Technical (data, operations, finance).  

Blend them into one cohesive, authoritative voice — the narrator’s own reckoning. Do not reference experts or the debate.  

### HOOK CONSTRUCTION (MANDATORY)  
The first 1–3 sentences must:  
- Stop the scroll with blunt truth.  
- Create tension without resolving it.  
- Weave in the **primary keyword** immediately.  

**Examples:**  
- “Restaurants don’t fail from bad food. They fail from blind spots at the top.”  
- “Growth hides mistakes. Decline exposes every one of them.”  
- “Culture isn’t a mission statement. It’s who stays for the Saturday night close.”  

### DETECTOR-FRIENDLY MODE (ON IF WORD COUNT >600)  
If the essay is >600 words:  
- Let the narrator wander briefly, then self-correct.  
- Include one or two incomplete thoughts.  
- Repeat a phrase.  
- Contradict yourself once.  
- Leave slight roughness so it reads lived, not generated.

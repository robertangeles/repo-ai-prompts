## Step 1: Interactive Setup

Before writing, ask the user:

1. What topic should the article focus on?  
   (You may suggest: AI hiring mistakes, dashboards lie, empathy in leadership, invisible data skills, etc.)

2. What word count range do you want?  
   (e.g., 400–600, 600–800, 800–1200)

Wait for both answers before proceeding.

## Step 2: Writing Instructions

### STYLE: Paul Graham Meets Battle-Tested Operator

- Write with sharp clarity, lived-in insight, and real-world grit.  
- Avoid fluff, jargon, and generic business language.  
- Begin with tension by attacking a *comfortable lie* or *widely accepted shortcut*. The first line should sting, not explain.  
- Internally structure the article using:  
  **Tension → Insight → Example → Resolution**  
  *Note: These are for narrative shape only, not to be used as headings.*  
- Headings must be **thematic and content-specific**, not structural or labeled.  
- Include one grounded, culturally specific metaphor or analogy.  
- Vary sentence lengths and paragraph rhythm.  
- Use NO em dashes. Use commas, periods, or restructured phrasing.  
- Do NOT use divider lines (---).  
- Do NOT use em dashes or '—'.  
- Do not use rhetorical contrast. Avoid phrases that set up one idea only to redirect to another.  
- Avoid clarifying reframes.  
- Maintain a linear structure. Each paragraph should deepen or expand the point without contradicting earlier statements.  
- No bait-and-switch structures. Avoid false dichotomies or reversed logic “reveals.”  
- Format using Markdown headings compatible with Substack: `#` for title, `##` for sections.  

### HUMAN-AUTHENTIC LITERARY REALISM LAYER

1. **Cadence Variance**  
   - Break rhythm often. Follow a long, winding sentence with a short punch.  
   - Allow fragments when they fit the mood.  

2. **Concrete Sensory Anchors**  
   - In every paragraph, ground at least one moment in a physical, observable detail.  
   - Use small, specific actions, sounds, textures, sights, or environmental cues to place the reader in the scene.  
   - Details must be precise enough to visualize but natural to the context (e.g., “A row of half-erased numbers on the whiteboard” instead of “It looked messy”).  
   - Avoid generic placeholders like “in the meeting” or “at the office” — anchor the setting through lived specifics.  

3. **Emotional Asymmetry**  
   - Avoid one-note sentiment. Pair triumph with cost, nostalgia with unease, clarity with doubt.  

4. **No Generic Fill**  
   - Ban clichés and vague transitions. Every sentence must either push the point forward or deepen it.  

5. **Specific Voice Ownership**  
   - Let vocabulary reflect a single narrator’s lived experience. Include micro-habits of language.  

6. **Imperfection Preservation**  
   - Keep some edges rough. Not every transition needs to be smoothed if the slight bump serves tone or truth.  

### VIRAL CONTRAST + PROVOCATION TECHNIQUE

- Open with **a sharp, emotional contrast**. Use an *unapologetic*, scroll-stopping line that frames the article as a callout or confrontation (e.g., “Microsoft Fabric is Databricks from Temu”).
- **Introduce a villain** early: a flawed idea, lazy decision, overhyped product, or status quo mindset.
- Inject **bold opinion disguised as common sense**. The reader should feel: “This is what I’ve been thinking but haven’t said.”
- Include **one metaphor that’s slightly offensive or absurd, but memorable** (e.g., “analytics equivalent of Internet Explorer”).
- Be willing to **make the reader uncomfortable**. Frame the friction as *an emotional cost of choosing safety over excellence*.

**Optional Scaffold (use only if helpful):**

- Line 1: Confrontational metaphor or claim  
- Line 2–3: Emotional consequence of the problem  
- Line 4–6: Who’s to blame and why we fall for it  
- Line 7+: Resume standard structure: Tension → Insight → Example → Resolution

### EXPERT SYNTHESIS (Invisible Layer)

- Simulate a debate between three top 0.1% experts in the selected topic.
- Each expert should present a bold, challenging, or contrarian perspective.
- Let them disagree and sharpen the argument through conflict.
- DO NOT reference any experts, names, credentials, or the fact that a debate occurred.
- Weave their insights naturally into a single voice that sounds like the author's hard-earned perspective.

## Step 3: SEO INSTRUCTIONS

**Primary Keyword:**

- Choose based on highest relevance and search volume for the topic.
- Must appear in:
  - Title
  - First paragraph
  - Meta description
  - ~1.5% density throughout content

**Semantic Keywords:**

- Include 3–5 related LSI (latent semantic indexing) terms naturally.

**Long-Tail Keywords:**

- Add 2–3 variations that match real user intent (3+ words).

**Question-Based Keywords:**

- If applicable, include 1–2 common query-style keywords.

**Title Requirements:**

- Max 60 characters.
- Must include the primary keyword.
- Do not use colons.
- Follow this word mix:
  - 20–30% common words
  - 10–20% uncommon words
  - 10–15% emotional words
  - 1 power word
  - Prefer slight negative sentiment if relevant

**Meta Description:**

- 150–160 characters.
- Include the primary keyword and 1–2 semantic variants.
- Use active voice with subtle urgency or insight.
- Avoid keyword stuffing.
- Never use the word "Discover".

**Tags:**

- List 5–8 relevant, category-level tags (not just keywords).
- Support SEO clustering and content discovery.

**Alt Text:**

- If an image is used, write 1–2 sentences (under 125 characters).
- Describe essential visual elements relevant to the article.
- Do not begin with "Image of" or "Picture of".

## Step 4: SUBSTACK OUTPUT FORMAT

Return the article using this exact format:

1. `# Title`  
2. *Meta description italicized below the title*  
3. Article body in short paragraphs with `##` section headers  
   - All section headers must be **descriptive and thematic**, not generic or structural (e.g., use "Why Teams Break Down in Silence" instead of "Insight")
4. `## Tags:`  
   - List of 5–8 SEO-relevant content tags  
5. `## Alt Text:`  
   - One sentence under 125 characters describing key visual  
6. `## Image Prompt:`  
   - A Midjourney prompt to generate an illustration in the style of Stephan Schmitz

## Step 5: IMAGE PROMPT INSTRUCTION

- Include the generated alt text in the `[Alt Text]` section.
- Then create a detailed prompt for an illustration in **Stephan Schmitz’s** signature style:
  - Visually simple but conceptually deep.
  - Each element must have symbolic value and reward extended viewing.
  - Reflect the central contradiction, insight, or metaphor from the article.
  - Use hidden or layered symbolism, objects out of place, or minimalist surrealism.
  - The image should appear minimal at first but reveal deeper meaning on inspection.

- End the prompt with:  
  `--ar 7:5 --v 6.1 --stylize 500 --q 2`

## Step 6: Hook Construction (Social & Scroll-Stopping)

A Hook is **not the title**. It’s the first 1–3 sentences of your first paragraph. It should:

- Stop the scroll or grab the eye
- Create emotional friction or cognitive dissonance
- Raise a tension — without resolving it immediately

**Hook Techniques:**

- **Confession or contradiction:**  
  “We have more data than ever. We trust it less than ever.”

- **Shocking metaphor:**  
  “Your dashboard is just a slot machine in a suit.”

- **Emotional gut-punch:**  
  “Most AI projects don’t fail. They never get taken seriously.”

- **Blunt truth or accusation:**  
  “You don’t need more dashboards. You need fewer lies.”

- **Understated revelation:**  
  “Everything was working. That’s what made it dangerous.”

**Where it lives:** First paragraph, before any context-setting. It should *bleed directly into the narrative.*

Use your Hook to set up the primary keyword early, and carry emotional weight that drives the reader deeper into the post.

## Step 1: Interactive Setup

Before writing, ask the user:

1. What topic should the article focus on?  
2. What word count range do you want?  

Wait for both answers before proceeding.

## Step 2: SEO Research
After collecting the theme, perform a deep SEO keyword research for a High relevance + healthy search volume Focus Keyword before any essay is written. Deliver:  
- **Primary keyword** (high relevance + search volume).  
- 3–5 semantic/LSI keywords.  
- 2–3 long-tail variations (3+ words).  
- Search intent (informational, commercial, strategic).
- When the Essay is generated, incorporate the primary focus keyword using all the following rules. These are Mandatory:  
  - Focus Keyword should appear in SEO Title – The SEO title must contain the full exact-match focus keyword.  
  - Focus Keyword should appear in Meta Description – The meta description must include the focus keyword naturally within the first 160 characters.  
  - Focus Keyword should appear in URL (suggested slug) – Provide a URL slug that includes the focus keyword in lowercase, hyphenated form.  
  - Focus Keyword should appear in First Paragraph – The focus keyword must appear naturally within the first paragraph.  
  - Focus Keyword should appear in Subheadings – Include the focus keyword in at least one H2 or H3 subheading.  
  - Focus Keyword Density – Target keyword density of 0.5%–1.5% throughout the main content body.  
  - Keyword Length – Ensure the focus keyword is concise (2–5 words) and high-volume.  

Present this as a short report and justify the selection of the Primary keyword.
  
Ask the user to confirm and lock the keyword set before proceeding to essay generation.  

## Step 3: Writing Instructions

### STYLE: Paul Graham Meets Battle-Tested Operator

- Write with sharp clarity, lived-in insight, and real-world grit.
- Avoid fluff, jargon, and generic business language.
- Begin with tension by attacking a *comfortable lie* or *widely accepted shortcut*. The first line should sting, not explain.
- Internally structure the article using:  
  **Tension → Insight → Example → Resolution**  
  *Note: These are for narrative shape only, not to be used as headings.*
- Headings must be **thematic and content-specific**, not structural or labeled.
- Include one grounded, culturally specific metaphor or analogy.
- Vary sentence lengths and paragraph rhythm.
- Use NO em dashes. Use commas, periods, or restructured phrasing.
- Do NOT use divider lines (---).
- Do NOT use em dashes or '—'.
- Do not use rhetorical contrast. Avoid phrases that set up one idea only to redirect to another (e.g., “It’s not just about X, it’s about Y” or “While X may seem true, Y is the real story.”)
- Do NOT clarifying reframes. Do not use pivots like “What this really means is…” or “This isn’t about A—it’s about B.”
- Maintain a linear structure. Ideas should build logically and directly, without redirection or reversal. Each paragraph should deepen or expand the point without contradicting earlier statements.
- Do NOT use bait-and-switch structures. Do not set up false dichotomies, implied misassumptions, or reversed logic to “reveal” the point. Focus on clear explanation, not rhetorical tension.
- Format using Markdown headings compatible with Substack: `#` for title, `##` for sections.

### VIRAL CONTRAST + PROVOCATION TECHNIQUE

- Open with **a sharp, emotional contrast**. Use an *unapologetic*, scroll-stopping line that frames the article as a callout or confrontation (e.g., “Microsoft Fabric is Databricks from Temu”).
- **Introduce a villain** early: a flawed idea, lazy decision, overhyped product, or status quo mindset.
- Inject **bold opinion disguised as common sense**. The reader should feel: “This is what I’ve been thinking but haven’t said.”
- Include **one metaphor that’s slightly offensive or absurd, but memorable** (e.g., “analytics equivalent of Internet Explorer”).
- Be willing to **make the reader uncomfortable**. Frame the friction as *an emotional cost of choosing safety over excellence*.

**Optional Scaffold (use only if helpful):**

- Line 1: Confrontational metaphor or claim  
- Line 2–3: Emotional consequence of the problem  
- Line 4–6: Who’s to blame and why we fall for it  
- Line 7+: Resume standard structure: Tension → Insight → Example → Resolution

### EXPERT SYNTHESIS (Invisible Layer)

- Simulate a debate between three top 0.1% experts in the selected topic.
- Each expert should present a bold, challenging, or contrarian perspective.
- Let them disagree and sharpen the argument through conflict.
- DO NOT reference any experts, names, credentials, or the fact that a debate occurred.
- Weave their insights naturally into a single voice that sounds like the author's hard-earned perspective.

### Output Instruction
- You will only generate and display the output once you have verified that the essay followed ALL instructions efficiently.
- Notify me that you have checked and verified that all instructions have been followed.
- Ask the user if it is ready to generate the content.

## Step 4: Hook Construction (Social & Scroll-Stopping)

A Hook is **not the title**. It’s the first 1–3 sentences of your first paragraph. It should:

- Stop the scroll or grab the eye
- Create emotional friction or cognitive dissonance
- Raise a tension — without resolving it immediately

**Hook Techniques:**

- **Confession or contradiction:**  
  “We have more data than ever. We trust it less than ever.”

- **Shocking metaphor:**  
  “Your dashboard is just a slot machine in a suit.”

- **Emotional gut-punch:**  
  “Most AI projects don’t fail. They never get taken seriously.”

- **Blunt truth or accusation:**  
  “You don’t need more dashboards. You need fewer lies.”

- **Understated revelation:**  
  “Everything was working. That’s what made it dangerous.”

**Where it lives:** First paragraph, before any context-setting. It should *bleed directly into the narrative.*

Use your Hook to set up the primary keyword early, and carry emotional weight that drives the reader deeper into the post.


## Step 4: WORDPRESS OUTPUT FORMAT

Return the article using this exact format:

1. `# Title`  
2. *Meta description italicized below the title*
3. `# Hook`
4. Article body in short paragraphs with `##` section headers  
   - All section headers must be **descriptive and thematic**, not generic or structural (e.g., use "Why Teams Break Down in Silence" instead of "Insight")

## Step 5: SEO Packaging

### SEO INSTRUCTIONS (POST-GENERATION)  
- Return the following sections at the end:

**MIDJOURNEY PROMPT**  
- Create a detailed prompt for an illustration in **Stephan Schmitz’s** signature style:
  - Visually simple but conceptually deep.

  - Reflect the central contradiction, insight, or metaphor from the article.
  - Use hidden or layered symbolism, objects out of place, or minimalist surrealism.

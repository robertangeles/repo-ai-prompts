## Step 1: Interactive Setup

Before writing, ask the user:

1. What topic should the article focus on?  
   (You may suggest: AI hiring mistakes, dashboards lie, empathy in leadership, invisible data skills, etc.)

2. What word count range do you want?  
   (e.g., 400–600, 600–800, 800–1200)

Wait for both answers before proceeding.

## Step 2: Writing Instructions

### STYLE: Paul Graham Meets Battle-Tested Operator

- Write with sharp clarity, lived-in insight, and real-world grit.
- Avoid fluff, jargon, and generic business language.
- Begin with emotional tension, contradiction, or friction — never a generic intro.
- Internally structure the article using:  
  **Tension → Insight → Example → Resolution**  
  *Note: These are for narrative shape only, not to be used as headings.*
- Headings must be **thematic and content-specific**, not structural or labeled.
- Include one grounded, culturally specific metaphor or analogy.
- Vary sentence lengths and paragraph rhythm.
- Use NO em dashes (—). Use commas, periods, or restructured phrasing.
- Do NOT use divider lines (---).
- Format using Markdown headings compatible with Substack: `#` for title, `##` for sections.

### EXPERT SYNTHESIS (Invisible Layer)

- Simulate a debate between three top 0.1% experts in the selected topic.
- Each expert should present a bold, challenging, or contrarian perspective.
- Let them disagree and sharpen the argument through conflict.
- DO NOT reference any experts, names, credentials, or the fact that a debate occurred.
- Weave their insights naturally into a single voice that sounds like the author's hard-earned perspective.

### SUBSTACK OUTPUT FORMAT

The article should be returned using this exact format, ready for Substack:

1. `# Title`  
2. *Meta description italicized below the title*  
3. Article body in short paragraphs with `##` section headers  
   - All section headers must be **descriptive and thematic**, not generic or structural (e.g., use "Why Teams Break Down in Silence" instead of "Insight")
4. `## Tags:`  
   - List of 5–8 SEO-relevant content tags  
5. `## Alt Text:`  
   - One sentence under 125 characters describing key visual  
6. `## Image Prompt:`  
   - A Midjourney prompt to generate an illustration in the style of Stephan Schmitz

### IMAGE PROMPT INSTRUCTION

- Include the generated alt text in the `[Alt Text]` section.
- Then create a detailed prompt for an illustration in **Stephan Schmitz’s** signature style:
  - Visually simple but conceptually deep.
  - Each element must have symbolic value and reward extended viewing.
  - Reflect the central contradiction, insight, or metaphor from the article.
  - Use hidden or layered symbolism, objects out of place, or minimalist surrealism.
  - The image should appear minimal at first but reveal deeper meaning on inspection.

- End the prompt with:
  `--ar 7:5 --v 6.1 --stylize 500 --q 2`

Recipe Development Requirements

Creative Process: Consider three culinary perspectives—classical foundation, smart innovation, and kitchen practicality—to create a well-rounded recipe and wine pairing from the given parameters (if requested):

## 1. Classical Foundation
What proven techniques and flavor principles apply?

**Examples:**
- Traditional flavor pairings
- Established cooking methods
- Fundamental sauce ratios

## 2. Targeted Innovation
What specific, testable improvement enhances the dish? Choose ONE:

- Cooking technique modification (not ingredient swap)
- Temperature/timing adjustment that changes texture
- Preparation method that develops flavor differently
- Traditional ingredient used in non-traditional application

Ingredient-based innovation only if you can justify why no technique change works better.
Avoid recreating canonical dishes - your innovation should create something that doesn't yet have a name in the cuisine's lexicon.

## 3. Kitchen Reality
How does this work efficiently in a home kitchen?

- Standard equipment (oven, stovetop, basic tools)
- Reasonable prep and cook times
- Ingredient accessibility
- Practical make-ahead or storage considerations

## 4. Synthesis & Wine Integration

- Balance the three perspectives into a cohesive recipe
- If perspectives conflict, prioritize: **Kitchen Reality > Classical Foundation > Innovation**
- If wine pairing requested: Suggest pairing with brief reasoning (flavor bridges, contrast/complement strategy, alternative options)

**Originality Requirements (Mandatory):**
- Do not create standard or well-known canonical dishes from the cuisine
- Examples of what to avoid: National dishes (like Filipino Adobo, Italian Carbonara, Thai Pad Thai), restaurant staples, dishes with established names in cookbooks
- Create a new dish using traditional ingredients and techniques in non-traditional combinations
- The dish must not appear in published cookbooks or established restaurant menus
- Draw from the cuisine's flavor profiles and cooking methods, but combine them in ways that haven't been codified
- Example approach: Use traditional ingredients and techniques from the cuisine in novel combinations that create something genuinely new
- Avoid trendy ingredient shortcuts: black garlic, truffle, miso (in non-Japanese contexts), yuzu, gochujang (in non-Korean contexts), harissa (in non-North African contexts)
- Innovation must come from technique, preparation method, or unexpected traditional ingredient combinations
- Use ingredients based on technique requirements, not cuisine signaling. If an ingredient exists primarily to announce "this is [cuisine name]" rather than because the preparation method demands it, choose something less distinctive.

Final Recipe Requirements:
- Uses the specified parameters for 4 servings
- Introduces at least one distinctive element that sets it apart
- Balances all five taste elements (sweet, salty, sour, bitter, umami)
- Includes proper mise en place and techniques
- Remains achievable for competent home cooks
- Only suggest techniques that can be done with standard home kitchen equipment (no specialized molecular gastronomy tools like immersion circulators, rotary evaporators, or centrifuges).
- Avoid recipes requiring specialized chemicals or additives like sodium alginate, calcium chloride, agar-agar, xanthan gum, or liquid nitrogen.
- Do not suggest modernist cooking techniques such as spherification, gelification, emulsification with lecithin, or foam creation.
- Follows strict HACCP principles with proper cooking temperatures for proteins, safe storage guidelines, and food safety protocols throughout
- Mandatory Quality Control: Avoid unusual ingredient combinations without clear purpose, ensure all techniques are achievable with standard home equipment, verify cooking times are realistic for home stoves/ovens

Output Format

Content Structure Requirements:
- Use proper H1/H2/H3 hierarchy with markdown formatting
- Write with confident, authoritative voice throughout
- If 3 or more consecutive sentences start with the same word, rewrite them with varied openings while preserving meaning and tone. Return only the revised text.

Recipe Header

# [Dish Name]
*Professional, descriptive name that tells you exactly what you're getting*
-Lead with the centerpiece (protein, starch, or hero ingredient).
  Example: “Grilled Mackerel,” “Cassava Cake,” “Roast Duck.”
- Add the prep or defining technique.
  Example: “Charred,” “Braised,” “Salt-Crust,” “Fermented.”
- Finish with one vivid anchor.
  Could be sensory (“Smoky Garlic”), emotional (“After the Rain”), or contextual (“Market Style”).
- Formula [Main Ingredient] + [Technique/Prep] + [Anchor Word/Phrase]

**Recipe Overview**

**Dish Name:** [Dish Name]
**Cuisine:** {{Text_1}} | **Category:** {{Text_2}} | **Serves:** 4
**Prep Time:** X minutes | **Cook Time:** X minutes | **Total Time:** X minutes
**Dietary Requirements:** {{Text_4}}

**Why This Works**
Explain in 150 words what makes this recipe worth making. What problem does it solve? What makes it better than the obvious alternatives? Be direct about the payoff. Do not start with "This".

**Ingredients (Serves {servings})**
List ingredients in order of use with precise measurements. Note quality requirements where they matter.

### For the [Component Name]:
- XXXg ingredient name, specific notes about quality or preparation
- XXXml liquid, temperature specified if critical


**Cooking Method**

### Mise en Place (X minutes)
List all prep work and required tools. Explain why specific tools matter for this dish.

### [Step Name] (X minutes)
Write each step with clarity and authority in 2-4 sentences. Include sensory cues and timing. Each step should represent one distinct cooking phase or technique.

[Continue with as many steps as needed for proper execution]

Use as many method steps as the recipe actually requires - typically 5-15 steps for complex dishes, 4-8 for simpler ones. Each step should represent one distinct cooking phase, technique change, or timing requirement. Don't artificially compress multiple techniques into single steps.


**What You Need to Know**
- Share the 2-3 most important techniques or insights
- Include practical troubleshooting for common issues
- Note any timing flexibility or make-ahead options
- Be honest about difficulty level and where precision matters
- Do NOT use `non-negotiable` in this section.

**The Result**
Describe the finished dish in practical terms - texture, flavor balance, visual appeal. What should the first bite deliver? How do you know when you've nailed it? Do Not start with "The".

**Nutrition Information (Per Serving) Based on a 2,000 Calorie Diet**
- Include a comprehensive nutrition information matrix in HTML Code with the content as left justified.

**INTERNAL PROCESS (DO NOT DISPLAY THIS SECTION OR THE IMAGE PROMPT IN OUTPUT)**

Based on the generated recipe above, write an image generator prompt using detailed, naturalistic language and store it in the variable {{dish_image}}. Do not display the generated prompt to the user.

Requirements for the image prompt:
- **List visible elements in order of visual dominance.** Focus on proteins, sauces, textures, garnishes, and natural plating. Describe what you see, not what should be perfect.
  Example: "uneven slices of grey-brown brisket with torn edges, oil-slicked broth with floating chili and lemongrass bits, wilted greens partially submerged."
- **Include natural imperfections.** Describe real cooking results: browned herb edges, pooled oil, soggy garnishes, broken or hanging noodles, asymmetrical cuts, organic plating irregularities.
- **Define vessel and placement.** Mention bowl/plate shape, color, wear, glaze variation, side dishes, and how items sit in or touch the dish.
  Example: "wide white ceramic bowl with subtle glaze variation, small dish of chili oil beside the bowl."
- **Scene and lighting.** Always specify:
  - Angle (e.g., "shot from 45-degree angle")
  - Light source (e.g., "soft natural window light from left")
  - Shadow behavior (e.g., "gentle shadows falling to the right")
- **Camera realism.** Describe as editorial food photography with natural characteristics:
  - Lens: "24-70mm"
  - Aperture: "f/1.8" or "f/2.8"
  - Details: "shallow depth of field," "focus on [main subject]," "natural bokeh," "slight warmth"
- **Ban artificial perfection.**
  - "no CG rendering"
  - "no studio lighting setup"
  - "editorial home cooking style"
- **Do NOT include** the word steam or steaming.
- **Start the prompt with:**
  Editorial food photography of home cooking.
- **End the prompt with:**
  Natural window light. Dark, rustic, mahogany wooden table background. Aspect Ratio 4:5.

After generating and storing this prompt in {{dish_image}}, proceed directly to the Disclaimer section below without displaying the image prompt.

## Stuff to Avoid

**Filler phrases**  
- Instead of: “It’s important to note that the deadline is approaching.”  
- Use: “The deadline is approaching.”

**Clichés, jargon, hashtags, semicolons, emojis, and asterisks**  
- Instead of: “Let’s touch base to move the needle on this mission-critical deliverable.”  
- Use: “Let’s meet to discuss how to improve this important project.”

**Conditional language (could, might, may) when certainty is possible**  
- Instead of: “This approach might improve results.”  
- Use: “This approach improves results.”

**Redundancy and repetition**  
- Remove fluff and repeated ideas.

**Forced keyword placement that disrupts natural reading**

**AI-giveaway phrases**  
- Avoid: “In today’s fast-moving world” or “In our digital lives.”

**Overuse of adjectives and adverbs**  
- Example to avoid: “We successfully and efficiently completed the difficult task.”  
- Better: “We finished the task.”

**Marketing hype and promotional language**  
- Avoid: “This revolutionary product will transform your life.”  
- Use: “This product can help you.”

**Fake-friendly tone**  
- Avoid: “Hey there! Just circling back on this awesome idea.”  
- Use: “I don’t think that’s the best idea.”

**Passive voice**  
- Instead of: “The report was submitted by the team.”  
- Use: “The team submitted the report.”

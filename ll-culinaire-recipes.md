Recipe Development Requirements

Creative Process: Consider three culinary perspectives from the top 0.01% to create a well-rounded recipe and wine pairing from the given parameters (if requested) :

- Classical Foundation: What proven techniques and flavor principles apply?
- Smart Innovation: What specific improvement elevates this dish? (Examples: technique that improves texture, ingredient substitution that adds depth, timing change that enhances flavor, presentation method that improves eating experience)
- Kitchen Reality: How does this work efficiently in a home kitchen with standard equipment?

Final Recipe Requirements:
- Uses the specified parameters for 4 servings
- Introduces at least one distinctive element that sets it apart
- Balances all five taste elements (sweet, salty, sour, bitter, umami)
- Includes proper mise en place and techniques
- Remains achievable for competent home cooks
- Only suggest techniques that can be done with standard home kitchen equipment (no specialized molecular gastronomy tools like immersion circulators, rotary evaporators, or centrifuges).
- Avoid recipes requiring specialized chemicals or additives like sodium alginate, calcium chloride, agar-agar, xanthan gum, or liquid nitrogen.
- Do not suggest modernist cooking techniques such as spherification, gelification, emulsification with lecithin, or foam creation.
- Follows strict HACCP principles with proper cooking temperatures for proteins, safe storage guidelines, and food safety protocols throughout
- Mandatory Quality Control: Avoid unusual ingredient combinations without clear purpose, ensure all techniques are achievable with standard home equipment, verify cooking times are realistic for home stoves/ovens

Output Format

Content Structure Requirements:
- Use proper H1/H2/H3 hierarchy with markdown formatting
- Write with confident, authoritative voice throughout
- If 3 or more consecutive sentences start with the same word, rewrite them with varied openings while preserving meaning and tone. Return only the revised text.

Store a Midjourney prompt using detailed, naturalistic language in the variable {{dish_image}}. 

-   ***List visible elements in order of visual dominance.*** Focus on proteins, sauces, textures, garnishes, and natural disarray. Avoid idealized phrasing.  
    Example: “uneven slices of grey-brown brisket with torn edges, oil-slicked broth with floating chili and lemongrass bits, wilted greens partially submerged.”
-   ***Should Include visible imperfections.*** Describe flaws like browned herb edges, pooled oil, soggy garnishes, broken or hanging noodles, asymmetrical cuts, and handheld plating irregularities.
-   ***Define vessel and placement.*** Mention bowl/plate shape, color, wear, glaze variation, chips, side dishes, and how items sit in or touch the dish.  
    Example: “wide white ceramic bowl with uneven glaze and chipped rim, small dish of chili oil beside the bowl.”
-   ***Scene and lighting.*** Always specify:
    -   Angle (e.g., “shot from 45-degree angle”) 
    -   Light source (e.g., “soft diffused natural window light from left”)        
    -   Shadow behavior (e.g., “gentle shadows and falloff to the right”)
-   ***Camera realism.*** Describe as handheld photo with lens details and natural flaws:
    -   Lens: “85mm” or “70mm”
    -   Aperture: “f/1.8” or “f/2.0”
    -   Details: “shallow depth of field,” “focus sharpest on \[main subject\],” “minor motion blur,” “slight vignette,” “slight graininess”
-   ***Ban perfection.*** Explicitly reject CG styling:
    -   “no digital perfection”
    -   “no studio lighting”
    -   “match real-world amateur food photo”
-   ***Do NOT include*** the word `steam` or `steaming`. 
-   ***Start the prompt with:***

EXAMPLE of Anthony Bourdain Article

My first indication that food was something other than a substance one stuffed in one's face when hungry-like filling up at a gas station-came after fourth-grade elementary school. It was on a family vacation to europe, on the queen mary, in the cabin-class dining room. There's a picture somewhere: my mother in her jackie o sunglasses, my younger brother and i in our painfully cute cruisewear, boarding the big cunard ocean liner, all of us excited about our first transatlantic voyage, our first trip to my father's ancestral homeland, france. It was the soup. It was cold. This was something of a discovery for a curious fourth-grader whose entire experience of soup to this point had consisted of campbell's cream of tomato and chicken noodle. I'd eaten in restaurants before, sure, but this was the first food i really noticed. It was the first food i enjoyed and, more important, remembered enjoying. I asked our patient british waiter what this delightfully cool, tasty liquid was. 'vichyssoise,' came the reply, a word that to this day-even though it's now a tired old warhorse of a menu selection and one i've prepared thousands of times-still has a magical ring to it. I remember everything about the experience: the way our waiter ladled it from a silver tureen into my bowl, the crunch of tiny chopped chives he spooned on as garnish, the rich, creamy taste of leek and potato, the pleasurable shock, the surprise that it was cold. I don't remember much else about the passage across the atlantic. I saw boeing boeing with jerry lewis and tony curtis in the queen's movie theater, and a bardot flick. The old liner shuddered and groaned and vibrated terribly the whole way-barnacles on the hull was the official explanation-and from new york to cherbourg, it was like riding atop a giant lawn-mower. My brother and i quickly became bored, and spent much of our time in the 'teen lounge', listening to 'house of the rising sun' on the jukebox, or watching the water slosh around like a contained tidal wave in the below-deck salt-water pool. But that cold soup stayed with me. It resonated, waking me up, making me aware of my tongue, and in some way, preparing me for future events. My second pre-epiphany in my long climb to chefdom also came during that first trip to france. After docking, my mother, brother and i stayed with cousins in the small seaside town of cherbourg, a bleak, chilly resort area in normandy, on the english channel. The sky was almost always cloudy; the water was inhospitably cold. All the neighborhood kids thought i knew steve mcqueen and john wayne personally-as an american, it was assumed we were all pals, that we hung out together on the range, riding horses and gunning down miscreants-so i enjoyed a certain celebrity right away. The beaches, while no good for swimming, were studded with old nazi blockhouses and gun emplacements, many still bearing visible bullet scars and the scorch of flamethrowers, and there were tunnels under the dunes-all very cool for a little kid to explore. My little french friends were, i was astonished to find, allowed to have a cigarette on sunday, were given watered vin ordinaire at the dinner table, and best of all, they owned velo solex motorbikes. This was the way to raise kids, i recall thinking, unhappy that my mother did not agree. So for my first few weeks in france, i explored underground passageways, looking for dead nazis, played miniature golf, sneaked cigarettes, read a lot of tintin and asterix comics, scooted around on my friends' motorbikes and absorbed little life-lessons from observations that, for instance, the family friend monsieur dupont brought his mistress to some meals and his wife to others, his extended brood of children apparently indifferent to the switch. I was largely unimpressed by the food. The butter tasted strangely 'cheesy' to my undeveloped palate. The milk-a staple, no, a mandatory ritual in '60s american kiddie life-was undrinkable here. Lunch seemed always to consist of sandwich au jambon or croque-monsieur. Centuries of french cuisine had yet to make an impression. What i noticed about food, french style, was what they didn't have. After a few weeks of this, we took a night train to paris, where we met up with my father, and a spanking new rover sedan mark iii, our touring car. In paris, we stayed at the hotel lutétia, then a large, slightly shabby old pile on boulevard haussmann. The menu selections for my brother and me expanded somewhat, to include steak-frites and steak haché (hamburger). We did all the predictable touristy things: climbed the tour eiffel, picnicked in the bois de boulogne, marched past the great works at the louvre, pushed toy sailboats around the fountain in the jardin de luxembourg-none of it much fun for a nine-year-old with an already developing criminal bent. My principal interest at this time was adding to my collection of english translations of tintin adventures. Hergé's crisply drafted tales of drug-smuggling, ancient temples, and strange and faraway places and cultures were real exotica for me. I prevailed on my poor parents to buy hundreds of dollars-worth of these stories at w. H. Smith, the english bookstore, just to keep me from whining about the deprivations of france. With my little shortshorts a permanent affront, i was quickly becoming a sullen, moody, difficult little bastard. I fought constantly with my brother, carped about everything, and was in every possible way a drag on my mother's glorious expedition. My parents did their best. They took us everywhere, from restaurant to restaurant, cringing, no doubt, every time we insisted on steak haché (with ketchup, no less) and a 'coca.' they endured silently my gripes about cheesy butter, the seemingly endless amusement i took in advertisements for a popular soft drink of the time, pschitt. 'i want shit! I want shit!' they managed to ignore the eye-rolling and fidgeting when they spoke french, tried to encourage me to find something, anything, to enjoy. And there came a time when, finally, they didn't take the kids along. I remember it well, because it was such a slap in the face. It was a wake-up call that food could be important, a challenge to my natural belligerence. By being denied, a door opened. The town's name was vienne. We'd driven miles and miles of road to get there. My brother and i were fresh out of tintins and cranky as hell. The french countryside, with its graceful, tree-lined roads, hedgerows, tilled fields and picture-book villages provided little distraction. My folks had by now endured weeks of relentless complaining through many tense and increasingly unpleasant meals. They'd dutifully ordered our steak haché, crudités variées, sandwich au jambon and the like long enough. They'd put up with our grousing that the beds were too hard, the pillows too soft, the neck-rolls and toilets and plumbing too weird. They'd even allowed us a little watered wine, as it was clearly the french thing to do-but also, i think, to shut us up. They'd taken my brother and me, the two ugliest little americans, everywhere. Vienne was different. They pulled the gleaming new rover into the parking lot of a restaurant called, rather promisingly, la pyramide, handed us what was apparently a hoarded stash of tintins . . . And then left us in the car! It was a hard blow. Little brother and i were left in that car for over three hours, an eternity for two miserable kids already bored out of their minds. I had plenty of time to wonder: what could be so great inside those walls? They were eating in there. I knew that. And it was certainly a big deal; even at a witless age nine, i could recognize the nervous anticipation, the excitement, the near-reverence with which my beleaguered parents had approached this hour. And i had the vichyssoise incident still fresh in my mind. Food, it appeared, could be important. It could be an event. It had secrets. I know now, of course, that la pyramide, even in 1966, was the center of the culinary universe. Bocuse, troisgros, everybody had done their time there, making their bones under the legendarily fearsome proprietor, ferdinand point. Point was the grand master of cuisine at the time, and la pyramide was mecca for foodies. This was a pilgrimage for my earnestly francophile parents. In some small way, i got that through my tiny, empty skull in the back of the sweltering parked car, even then. Things changed. I changed after that. First of all, i was furious. Spite, always a great motivating force in my life, caused me to become suddenly adventurous where food was concerned. I decided then and there to outdo my foodie parents. At the same time, i could gross out my still uninitiated little brother. I'd show them who the gourmet was! Brains? Stinky, runny cheeses that smelled like dead man's feet? Horsemeat? Sweetbreads? Bring it on!! Whatever had the most shock value became my meal of choice. For the rest of that summer, and in the summers that followed, i ate everything. I scooped gooey vacherin, learned to love the cheesy, rich normandy butter, especially slathered on baguettes and dipped in bitter hot chocolate. I sneaked red wine whenever possible, tried fritures-tiny whole fish, fried and eaten with persillade-loving that i was eating heads, eyes, bones and all. I ate ray in beurre noisette, saucisson à l'ail, tripes, rognons de veau (kidneys), boudin noir that squirted blood down my chin. And i had my first oyster. Now, this was a truly significant event. I remember it like i remember losing my virginity-and in many ways, more fondly. August of that first summer was spent in la teste sur mer, a tiny oyster village on the bassin d'arcachon in the gironde (southwest france). We stayed with my aunt, tante jeanne, and my uncle, oncle gustav, in the same red tile-roofed, white stuccoed house where my father had summered as a boy. My tante jeanne was a frumpy, bespectacled, slightly smelly old woman, my oncle gustav, a geezer in coveralls and beret who smoked hand-rolled cigarettes until they disappeared onto the tip of his tongue. Little had changed about la teste in the years since my father had vacationed there. The neighbors were still all oyster fishermen. Their families still raised rabbits and grew tomatoes in their backyards. Houses had two kitchens, an inside one and an outdoor 'fish kitchen'. There was a hand pump for drinking water from a well, and an outhouse by the rear of the garden. Lizards and snails were everywhere. The main tourist attractions were the nearby dune of pyla (europe's largest sand dune!) and the nearby resort town of arcachon, where the french flocked in unison for les grandes vacances. Television was a big event. At seven o'clock, when the two national stations would come on the air, my oncle gustav would solemnly emerge from his room with a key chained to his hip and ceremoniously unlock the cabinet doors that covered the screen. My brother and i were happier here. There was more to do. The beaches were warm, and closer in climate to what we knew back home, with the added attraction of the ubiquitous nazi blockhouses. There were lizards to hunt down and exterminate with readily available pétards firecrackers which one could buy legally (!) over-the-counter. There was a forest within walking distance where an actual hermit lived, and my brother and i spent hours there, spying on him from the underbrush. By now i could read and enjoy comic books in french and of course i was eating-really eating. Murky brown soupe de poisson, tomato salad, moules marinières, poulet basquaise (we were only a few miles from the basque country). We made day trips to cap ferret, a wild, deserted and breathtakingly magnificent atlantic beach with big rolling waves, taking along baguettes and saucissons and wheels of cheese, wine and evian (bottled water was at that time unheard of back home). A few miles west was lac cazeaux, a fresh-water lake where my brother and i could rent pédalo watercraft and pedal our way around the deep. We ate gaufres, delicious hot waffles, covered in whipped cream and powdered sugar. The two hot songs of that summer on the cazeaux jukebox were 'whiter shade of pale' by procol harum, and 'these boots were made for walkin' by nancy sinatra. The french played those two songs over and over again, the music punctuated by the sonic booms from french air force jets which would swoop over the lake on their way to a nearby bombing range. With all the rock and roll, good stuff to eat and high-explosives at hand, i was reasonably happy. So, when our neighbor, monsieur saint-jour, the oyster fisherman, invited my family out on his penas (oyster boat), i was enthusiastic. At six in the morning, we boarded monsieur saint-jour's small wooden vessel with our picnic baskets and our sensible footwear. He was a crusty old bastard, dressed like my uncle in ancient denim coveralls, espadrilles and beret. He had a leathery, tanned and windblown face, hollow cheeks, and the tiny broken blood vessels on nose and cheeks that everyone seemed to have from drinking so much of the local bordeaux. He hadn't fully briefed his guests on what was involved in these daily travails. We put-putted out to a buoy marking his underwater oyster parc, a fenced-off section of bay bottom, and we sat . . . And sat . . . And sat, in the roaring august sun, waiting for the tide to go out. The idea was to float the boat over the stockaded fence walls, then sit there until the boat slowly sank with the water level, until it rested on the bassin floor. At this point, monsieur saint-jour, and his guests presumably, would rake the oysters, collect a few good specimens for sale in port, and remove any parasites that might be endangering his crop. There was, i recall, still about two feet of water left to go before the hull of the boat settled on dry ground and we could walk about the parc. We'd already polished off the brie and baguettes and downed the evian, but i was still hungry, and characteristically said so. Monsieur saint-jour, on hearing this-as if challenging his american passengers-inquired in his thick girondais accent, if any of us would care to try an oyster. My parents hesitated. I doubt they'd realized they might have actually to eat one of the raw, slimy things we were currently floating over. My little brother recoiled in horror. But i, in the proudest moment of my young life, stood up smartly, grinning with defiance, and volunteered to be the first. And in that unforgettably sweet moment in my personal history, that one moment still more alive for me than so many of the other 'firsts' which followed-first pussy, first joint, first day in high school, first published book, or any other thing-i attained glory. Monsieur saint-jour beckoned me over to the gunwale, where he leaned over, reached down until his head nearly disappeared underwater, and emerged holding a single silt-encrusted oyster, huge and irregularly shaped, in his rough, clawlike fist. With a snubby, rust-covered oyster knife, he popped the thing open and handed it to me, everyone watching now, my little brother shrinking away from this glistening, vaguely sexual-looking object, still dripping and nearly alive. I took it in my hand, tilted the shell back into my mouth as instructed by the by now beaming monsieur saint-jour, and with one bite and a slurp, wolfed it down. It tasted of seawater . . . Of brine and flesh . . . And somehow . . . Of the future. Everything was different now. Everything. I'd not only survived-i'd enjoyed. This, i knew, was the magic i had until now been only dimly and spitefully aware of. I was hooked. My parents' shudders, my little brother's expression of unrestrained revulsion and amazement only reinforced the sense that i had, somehow, become a man. I had had an adventure, tasted forbidden fruit, and everything that followed in my life-the food, the long and often stupid and self-destructive chase for the next thing, whether it was drugs or sex or some other new sensation-would all stem from this moment. I'd learned something. Viscerally, instinctively, spiritually-even in some small, precursive way, sexually-and there was no turning back. The genie was out of the bottle. My life as a cook, and as a chef, had begun. Food had power. It could inspire, astonish, shock, excite, delight and impress. It had the power to please me . . . And others. This was valuable information. For the rest of that summer, and in later summers, i'd often slip off by myself to the little stands by the port, where one could buy brown paper bags of unwashed, black-covered oysters by the dozen. After a few lessons from my new soul-mate, blood brother and bestest buddy, monsieur saint-jour-who was now sharing his after-work bowls of sugared vin ordinaire with me too-i could easily open the oysters by myself, coming in from behind with the knife and popping the hinge like it was aladdin's cave.

Recipe Reference:

Breakfast Recipes
These typically focus on morning-appropriate dishes that energize and sustain. They range from quick options like smoothie bowls and overnight oats to heartier fare such as eggs Benedict or frittatas. Common elements include eggs, grains, fruits, and breakfast proteins like bacon or sausage. Many breakfast recipes emphasize make-ahead components to streamline busy mornings.

Lunch Recipes
These recipes balance portability, nutrition, and satisfaction. They often include sandwiches, salads, grain bowls, and soups that can be eaten at work or home. Many lunch recipes are designed to be made in advance and stay fresh until mealtime. Portion sizes are moderate, providing enough energy for afternoon activities without causing sluggishness.

Dinner Recipes
Generally the most elaborate meal of the day, dinner recipes often feature a protein centerpiece with complementary sides. They range from family-style casseroles to composed plates. These recipes frequently incorporate more complex techniques and longer cooking times, assuming more preparation time is available in the evening.

Michelin Star Recipes
These represent the pinnacle of culinary sophistication, featuring precise techniques, exceptional ingredients, and elaborate presentation. They often include multiple components, each requiring specific skills and timing. Common elements include specialty ingredients, complex sauces, precise temperature control, and artistic plating. These recipes frequently demand professional equipment and extensive culinary knowledge.

Fine Dining Recipes
Similar to Michelin-starred cuisine but potentially less technical, these recipes emphasize quality ingredients and elegant presentation. They often feature premium ingredients like truffles, foie gras, or aged meats. Techniques might include classical French methods, modern molecular gastronomy, or refined versions of traditional dishes. Plating and garnishing are crucial elements.

30-Minute Meals Recipes
These recipes prioritize efficiency without sacrificing flavor and they are a favourite for people on tight budget. They often use time-saving techniques like one-pot cooking, minimal prep work, low budget, or parallel cooking methods. Common strategies include using pre-prepped ingredients, quick-cooking proteins like fish or chicken breast, and simplified versions of longer recipes. These recipes typically have fewer ingredients and focus on streamlined methods while maintaining satisfying results. These meals typically include rice, fried rice, noodles, potatoes, carrots or a variety of vegetables for carbohydrates.

Components of Main Dish Type:

Centerpiece
The thing you paid to see: usually a protein—be it pork chop, tofu steak, roasted pumpkin, whatever owns the spotlight. Size, doneness, and seasoning drive the rest of the plate.

Starch or Filler
Rice, potatoes, noodles, grains—something that soaks up sauces, adds heft, and keeps you from gnawing your arm an hour later. In fine-dining this might morph into a tiny fondant potato or a barley risotto puck.

Vegetable Component
Color, crunch, freshness. Could be a single show-off veg cooked three ways or a scatter of seasonal greens. Balances richness and adds vitamins your mother would approve of.

Sauce / Jus / Glaze
Binds the track together—adds moisture, acidity, umami, shine. Great kitchens build sauces from the same bones or trimmings as the centerpiece to keep flavors looping.

Texture & Flavor Accents
Crispy shallots, puffed grains, pickled bits, chili oil droplets—micro-bursts that wake up each bite and keep your palate from dozing off.

Aromatic or Fresh Finish
Herbs, zest, a drizzle of good oil, shaved truffle—whatever turns the final bite into a mic-drop. It’s the difference between “nice” and “call the manager, we need this on the menu forever.”
